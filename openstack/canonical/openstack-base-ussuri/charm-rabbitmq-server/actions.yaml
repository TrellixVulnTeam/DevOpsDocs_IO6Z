force-boot:
  description: |
    Set the `force_boot` flag and restart the RabbitMQ broker. This
    action should be performed if a unit in the RabbitMQ cluster is
    failing to boot after an uncontrolled shutdown of the cluster.
    Note that units of a RabbitMQ cluster have to be booted in reverse
    shutdown order. Also note that this potentially leads to a loss of
    messages, in particular if the cluster received messages after the
    unit was shut down.
