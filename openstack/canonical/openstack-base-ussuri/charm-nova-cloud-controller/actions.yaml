clear-unit-knownhost-cache:
  params:
    target:
      type: string
      default: ""
  description: |
    Clear the knownhost cache for (default) all the units, a service, or a
    single unit.
    .
    The default is all units.  If the 'target' param has an '/' in it, then it
    is assumed ot be a single unit.  If no '/' is present, then all the units
    in a service will be refreshed.
    .
    e.g. target="nova-compute/4" will just clear the nova-compute/4 unit (in
    the 'nova-compute' application), whereas target='nova-compute' will refresh
    all of the units in the 'nova-compute' application.
    .
    The action triggers a refresh resolution of the known hosts for the unit,
    which then populates the cache, updates the knownhosts file for the
    associated service (e.g. 'nova-compute'), and, importantly, sets the
    relation data for that associated service with the new knownhosts file.
    This may cause a 'cloud-compute' relation changed hook on the associated
    nova-compute units if the hosts have changed.
    .
    This action still functions even if the 'cache-known-hosts' config value is
    not set; caching of hosts occurs regardless of that setting, and so this
    action can be used to force an update if DNS has changed in the system, or
    for a particular host (although this scenario is unlikely).
